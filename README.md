### Hello there ! 

Moogs here, survivor of France's mathematics "pr√©pa" and programming enthusiast. 

You'll find all sorts of things here, feel free to dig through, as most of my projects will be licensed under MIT. 

### Interests 

My two main interests, programming and drawing, are linked by a will to give free rein to my imagination. 
I chose to follow a scientific curriculum as soon as I had the choice. It's diversity allowed me to discover a particular fondness for both mathematics, mainly linear algebra, and philosphy, as it let us think unconstrained.

### Hello there ! 

Moogs here, survivor of France's mathematics "pr√©pa" and programming enthusiast. 

You'll find all sorts of things here, feel free to dig through, as most of my projects will be licensed under MIT. 

### Interests 

My two main interests, programming and drawing, are linked by a will to give free rein to my imagination.
